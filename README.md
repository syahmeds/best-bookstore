# react-bookstore

React BookStore App. Implemented using React and Firebase

## Features

- View available books (items)
- Add books (items) to order
- Sign in using Github Account
- Manage store inventory after signing in
- Order data stored in local storage
- Store inventory in Firebase DB
- There's a dynamic update and syncing of the inventory status between DB and app instances

## Getting started

Clone the repository from `git@bitbucket.org:ahmedsyed212/best-bookstore.git` and run (requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)):

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then run:

```bash
$ npm run styles
$ npm run dev
```

## Dependencies

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Extensions/Reflections

- Started out to demonstrate state, components and props in React
- Used firebase for single-sign on and database
- Would be good to track count of inventory rather than the statuses `Available` and `Sold Out`
- Would be good to add `Place Order` and `Track Order` options
